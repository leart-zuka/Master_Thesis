# Vacuum_Chamber

The vacuum chamber looks as following:

## In-Vacuum Components

In the center of the vacuum chamber are the [crossed optical fiber cavity.](experiment/Crossed_Optical_Fiber_Cavity.md)
Above the cavity two mirrors are located which reflect the `MOT` beams which enter via the upper viewport:

Furthermore three single-loop microwave antennas are installed in order to coherently manipulate atomic ground staes

Furthermore three single-loop microwave antennas are installed in order to coherently manipulate atomic ground staes.

Atoms are provided by two $^{87}Rb$ dispensers which, once released into the vacuum, load the MOT. The dispenser is positioned in a way, that when the atoms are released, they don't make direct contact with the cavity mirrors, since they get blocked by the MOT mirrors, and don't ruin the high finesse cavity mirrors.
