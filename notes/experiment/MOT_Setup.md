# MOT_Setup

The `Magneto-Optical Trap` (`MOT`) is the first instance where we trap atoms before eventually and actually trapping them in the cavities.

## Technical Description

As the name suggests there are two requirements in order to construct a MOT:

- A magnetic field
- Optical beams

A conventional MOT requires a magnetic gradient field, that is typically generated by two current coils, and three counter-propagating optical beam pairs that are orthogonally aligned to each other.

The MOT coils are positioned outside the vacuum chamber. The symmetry axis of both MOT coils points through the viewports in our chamber.

The MOT utilizes three retro-reflected optical beams. One beam is horizontally aligned, codirectional to the MOT coil symmetry axis, and is retro-reflected on the other side of the vacuum chamber. 
The remaining two beams enter the vacuum chamber via the re-entrant viewport. They reflect off two in-vacuum mirrors and are subsequently retro-reflected outside the vacuum chamber. A $\lambda/4$ waveplate is positioned in front of each retro-reflecting mirror so as to maintain the MOT beam helicity.
With this beam configuration, the MOT beams' crossing point is located 10mm above the horizontal cavities place.
