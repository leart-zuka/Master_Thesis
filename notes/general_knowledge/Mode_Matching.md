# Mode_Matching

In many situations, it is necessary to spatially match a laser beam precisely to another beam of a [mode](general_knowledge/Light_Modes.md) to obtain some kind of efficient coupling.

This is for example very prevalent when coupling in and out of an optical [fibers](general_knowledge/Fibers.md).

The necessary matching of modes means not only creating a good spatial overlap of the intensity profiles, but also matching the `optical phase` profiles. In other words, the `wavefronts` of the beams will then be matched. If the amplitude profiles are well matched in a certain plane, they will remain well matched during further propagation.

Mode matching can be achieved by using suitable relay optics (typically some combination of curved mirrors or lenses), provided that the `beam quality` of the initial beam is close to the `diffraction limit`

Quality of the matching can be quantified by the following equation (assuming same polarization):
